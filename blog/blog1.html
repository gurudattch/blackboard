<p>If you’ve seen the headlines and feel overwhelmed, you aren’t alone. Here is a simple breakdown of the massive military event that began on February 28, 2026.</p>

<h3>Q: What is "Operation Epic Fury"?</h3> 
<p> It is a large-scale, joint military attack launched by the United States and Israel against Iran. It involves hundreds of fighter jets, missiles, and drones hitting targets across Iran. </p>
  
<h3>2. Why did it start?</h3>
<p>On February 28, 2026, the U.S. and Israel launched Operation Epic Fury. The stated reasons were:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nuclear Prevention:</strong> To destroy Iran’s nuclear enrichment facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Regime Change:</strong> President Trump explicitly called for the removal of the Iranian government.</li>
<li><strong>Leadership Strike:</strong> The operation successfully targeted and killed Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Why is Iran attacking countries like Qatar and the UAE?</h3>
<p>Iran is not at war with the Gulf countries themselves. Instead, they are targeting the U.S. military bases located within those countries.</p>
<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>The Goal:</strong> To disable the airfields and command centres that the U.S. uses to launch attacks against Iran.<br>
<strong>The Message:</strong> Iran has warned that any country allowing the U.S. to use their soil for attacks will be treated as a "legitimate target."
<h3>Q: Did something big happen to Iran’s leadership?</h3>
<p>Yes. Iranian state media confirmed that Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, was killed during the initial strikes. This has created a massive power vacuum in the country.</p>

<h3>Q: Is this just a fight between three countries?</h3>
<p>Not anymore. Once the strikes began, Iran launched retaliatory missiles at U.S. bases in nearby countries like Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE. Because of this, the entire Middle East (West Asia) is currently in a state of high alert or active combat.</p>

<h3>Q: How does this affect me if I’m not in the Middle East?</h3>
<p>The biggest impact for most people is economic.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Oil & Gas:</strong> Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow waterway where much of the world's oil passes. This usually causes gas prices to spike globally.</li>
<li><strong>Shipping</strong> International trade routes are being diverted, which can delay goods and increase prices.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Q: If Iran is mad at the U.S. and Israel, why hit countries like Qatar or the UAE?</h3>
<p>Because of geography. The U.S. doesn't just fly planes from America; they use massive military bases located inside these Gulf countries. Iran argues that if a country allows the U.S. to launch "Operation Epic Fury" from its soil, that country is no longer neutral—it’s a participant.</p>
  
<h3>Q: What is the "Launchpad" argument?</h3>
<p>Iran views these bases (like Al Udeid in Qatar or Al Dhafra in the UAE) as the literal "launchpads" for the bombs hitting Tehran. To Iran, attacking these bases is a way to try and "disable the runway" so the U.S. can't send more planes.</p>

<h3>Q: Is Iran trying to start a war with its neighbors too?</h3>
<p>A: Not necessarily. This is a tactic called Strategic Deterrence. By hitting these areas, Iran is sending a terrifying message to its neighbors: "Tell the Americans to stop, or your cities will be next." They are trying to pressure the Gulf leaders to kick the U.S. military out or refuse them permission to use their airspace.</p>

<h3>Q: Why was Oman left alone?</h3>
<p>Oman has practiced a very strict "friend to all" policy for decades. Because they did not allow their land to be used for the attack and have acted as a peaceful middleman (mediator), Iran has no "military reason" to target them.</p>

<h3>Q: How does the "Strait of Hormuz" fit into this?</h3>
<p>This is Iran's biggest economic weapon. Since the Gulf countries rely on selling oil to survive, Iran can threaten their entire economy by attacking ships in this narrow waterway. It’s a way of saying: "If our oil industry is destroyed by your 'friends' (the U.S.), we won't let you sell yours either."</p>

<h3>Q: Is there any old "beef" involved?</h3>
<p>Yes. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Iran have been rivals for a long time, often supporting opposite sides in smaller wars (like in Yemen). This current chaos has unfortunately allowed those old tensions to explode into direct fighting.</p>

<h3>The Simple Analogy:</h3>
<p>Imagine a bully is standing in your neighbor’s driveway throwing rocks at your house. Even if you aren't mad at your neighbor, you might start throwing rocks back at that driveway to make the bully stop—and in the process, your neighbor's property gets damaged.</p>

<h3>Q: I’m seeing a lot of conflicting news. What should I believe?</h3>
<p>In the first 48 hours of any war, "the fog of war" is real.</p>
<ul>
<li>False Media: Be careful of "old" videos from previous wars being shared as "live footage."</li>
<li>The Bottom Line: As of today, the situation is extremely fluid. Major cities like Tehran and Tel Aviv are under missile fire, and the regional map is changing by the hour.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Economic Impact Report</h3>
<p>As of March 1, 2026, the conflict has triggered a "geopolitical risk premium."</p>
<p><strong style="color:var(--secondary)">📈 What Goes UP:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Global Oil Prices:</strong> Brent crude surged over 3.4% to approximately $73 per barrel.</li>
<li><strong>Gold & Assets:</strong> Investors moving money into safe-haven assets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="color:var(--primary)">📉 What Goes DOWN:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flight Availability:</strong> Over 700 flights cancelled across GCC.</li>
<li><strong>Stock Markets:</strong> Airline and tourism stocks reacting sharply downward.</li>
</ul>
